Implementation of Various AI search Algorithm - Best_first_search  Hill_Climbing Beam_Search A_Star Mix_Beam_Hill_search 

A random weighted connected graph with 10 million cities with designated start and goal cities.

Implemented Best First Search, Hill Climbing and A* search for searching the goal city in the graph if a path from start city to goal city exists.

Plotting the searching time and required memory to compare the above algorithms.
